This package contains all files related to the bot's functionality with
his own cups.  A description of this implementation is below:

DESCRIPTION:
The bot is configured such that there is a set of cups set up in a pong
formation in front of the robotic arm.  There is an overhead calibrated
camera that has the cups and a "dump" in its field of view.

This system should be able to detect the cups' rings, and if there is a
pong ball inside one.  If there is a ball inside one of the cup's rings,
the robotic arm should pull the cup from the playing field and place it
in the dump.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Simple overhead Camera Calibration techniques
2. Object Detection (pong ball)
3. Ring Detection (cup)
4. Robotic Inverse Kinematics

OUTLINE:
Camera Calibration -
	o  Solve for affine transformation between camera coordinates and
	world coordinates.
	o  Affine transformation will be used to retrieve real world
	coordinates of a cup with a ball inside of it
	o  Real world coordinates are then fed to the Robotic Inverse
	Kinematics system to retrieve cup, and place it in the dump

Object Detection -
	o  

Ring Detection -
	o 

Robotic Inverse Kinematics -
	o Given a real world coordinate, the robotic arm should be able to
	grab a cup's ring at that coordinate, pick it up vertically so as to
	not disturb the cups around it, and transfer it safely to the dump
	o  Home Position = full arm erect
	o
