This package contains all files related to the bot's functionality with
his opponent's cups.  A description of this implementation is below:

DESCRIPTION:
The bot should be able to pick up a pong ball from a line, and determine
the correct trajectory to throw the ball to sink the pong ball into an
opponent's cup.

This system should be able to detect the opponent's cups using stereo
vision and image rectification to solve for the center of a cup's ring. 
The arm will be trained with machine learning to solve for the best way
to shoot the ball toward a given coordinate.

REQUIREMENTS:
1.  3D Stereo Vision Calibration
2.  Robotic Kinematics w/ Machine Learning
